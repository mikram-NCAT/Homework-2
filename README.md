# Visualization and Image Preprocessing

This homework focuses on improving data visualization and performing basic image preprocessing using Python.

# üìä Visualization Enhancements

Modified all plots by changing colors, fonts, and layout designs.

Used a variety of colormap combinations such as viridis, coolwarm, and RdYlBu_r for better contrast and presentation.

Customized font styles, sizes, and colors for titles, labels, and legends to make the graphs visually appealing.

Experimented with multiple plot types including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and 3D surface plots.

Adjusted grid spacing, transparency, and colorbars to enhance clarity and readability.

Saved all figures in high-resolution PNG format using plt.savefig() for clean documentation.

# üñºÔ∏è Image Preprocessing

Uploaded and used an image of my daughter for the image preprocessing section.

Applied basic preprocessing techniques such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and noise filtering.

Demonstrated how preprocessing helps prepare images for further analysis or model training.

# üß† Model Training and Face Detection

In this part of the assignment, I trained and evaluated two machine learning models ‚Äî Logistic Regression (LR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) ‚Äî using the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification.
Both models were trained after proper data preprocessing and standardization to ensure consistent input scaling and better performance.
Logistic Regression Accuracy: 91.54%
Random Forest Accuracy: 96.75%
MLP Accuracy: 97.12%

Additionally, I implemented a YOLO-based face detection model.
A pre-trained YOLOv8n-Face model was used to detect and localize faces in real images.
I tested the model on my own uploaded photo, and the detection results were visualized with bounding boxes around detected faces.
This demonstrated the practical use of deep learning models for real-world computer vision tasks.
