# Part 1 Visualization and Image Preprocessing

This homework focuses on improving data visualization and performing basic image preprocessing using Python.

#üìä Visualization Enhancements

Modified all plots by changing colors, fonts, and layout designs.

Used a variety of colormap combinations such as viridis, coolwarm, and RdYlBu_r for better contrast and presentation.

Customized font styles, sizes, and colors for titles, labels, and legends to make the graphs visually appealing.

Experimented with multiple plot types including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and 3D surface plots.

Adjusted grid spacing, transparency, and colorbars to enhance clarity and readability.

Saved all figures in high-resolution PNG format using plt.savefig() for clean documentation.

#üñºÔ∏è Image Preprocessing

Uploaded and used an image of my daughter for the image preprocessing section.

Applied basic preprocessing techniques such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and noise filtering.

Demonstrated how preprocessing helps prepare images for further analysis or model training.
